        <h3>So what is gelato?</h3>
        <p>
            <s class="right-justify">Amazing chef's kiss. No notes.</s> Kidding.  
            Gelato is a traditional Italian frozen dessert similar to ice cream but with a few key differences. 
            It is made with milk, sugar, and sometimes cream, along with natural flavorings like fruit, nuts, or chocolate. 
            Unlike ice cream, gelato has less air churned into it, making it denser and more flavorful. 
            It also contains less butterfat, usually around 4-8%, compared to ice cream’s 10-20%. 
            Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature, which enhances its smooth texture and rich taste. 
            Authentic gelato is made fresh in small batches, often using high-quality, natural ingredients. 
            Popular flavors include pistachio, hazelnut, stracciatella (chocolate chip), and fruity sorbets. 
            In Italy, gelato shops, or "gelaterias," are common, and locals enjoy it year-round. 
            Traditional gelato is made without artificial preservatives, so it’s best enjoyed fresh. 
            Overall, gelato is a delicious, creamy treat that offers a more intense flavor experience than typical ice cream. (Public Domain)
